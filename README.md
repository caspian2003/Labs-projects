Internship Reports: Capture The Flag (CTF) Learning Journey

  

This repository documents my internship reports based on hands-on cybersecurity learning through Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms. It includes detailed walkthroughs, reflections, and technical insights gained by solving beginner to intermediate challenges.

Platforms Covered

1. OverTheWire Wargames

Krypton: Focused on basic cryptography (e.g., Caesar cipher, ROT13, XOR).

Natas: Web security challenges (directory traversal, XSS, command injection, etc.).

Leviathan: Linux privilege escalation and basic binary exploitation.


2. TryHackMe

Covers Linux and Windows challenges designed for beginner to intermediate levels.

Topics include:

OS enumeration and exploitation

File permission misconfigurations

Basic privilege escalation techniques

Active Directory fundamentals (for Windows)



3. Proxy Configuration

Configured HTTP/HTTPS traffic interception tools:

Burp Suite, FoxyProxy, and browser configurations


Used for analyzing and manipulating web traffic during CTFs
